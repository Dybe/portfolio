      <p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">I am a senior at Brown University pursuing a BS in Computer Science and
        Economics. I am a firm believer in
        tech as a tool for economic mobility of the masses as it makes education and income-earning
        opportunities more accessible. I love to take part in building technological solutions in line with this belief
        and have done so in the past first as a Software Developer and then as a Product/Program Manager.

      <p>In my recent work, I have focused on learning how to make user interfaces more usable that is making it
        easier for users to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>achieve their objectives for using the interface</li>
        <li>learn and become familiar with the inteface quickly</li>
        <li>recall this learning in their subsequent visits</li>
      </ul>
